## Final project: FPGA programming

The aim was to program an FPGA to work as a shopping cart.
VHDL was the chosen language using Quartus Prime.
The project was never tested on the FPGA Board as it was developed during a pandemic.
But was successfully simulated on ModelSim Simulator along with a few bugs.
